        <div class="principle-content">
          <p>Google aspires to create technologies that solve important problems and help people in their daily lives. We are optimistic about the incredible potential for AI and other advanced technologies to empower people, widely benefit current and future generations, and work for the common good. We believe that these technologies will promote innovation and further our mission to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.</p>
          <p>We recognize that these same technologies also raise important challenges that we need to address clearly, thoughtfully, and affirmatively.  These principles set out our commitment to develop technology responsibly and establish specific application areas we will not pursue.</p>

        <h2 class="principle-sub-title text-center">Objectives for AI Application</h2>

        <p class="description">We will assess AI applications in view of the following objectives. We believe that AI should:</p>

        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#beneficial" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="beneficial">
          <h4>1. Be socially beneficial.</h4>
        </a>
        <hr>
        <div class="content" id="beneficial">
          <p>The expanded reach of new technologies increasingly touches society as a whole. Advances in AI will have transformative impacts in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, security, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and entertainment. As we consider potential development and uses of AI technologies, we will take into account a broad range of social and economic factors, and will proceed where we believe that the overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.</p>
          <p>AI also enhances our ability to understand the meaning of content at scale. We will strive to make high-quality and accurate information readily available using AI, while continuing to respect cultural, social, and legal norms in the countries where we operate. And we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate when to make our technologies available on a non-commercial basis.</p>

        </a>
        <hr>
        <div class="content" id="unfair-bias">
          <p>AI algorithms and datasets can reflect, reinforce, or reduce unfair biases. We recognize that distinguishing fair from unfair biases is not always simple, and differs across cultures and societies. We will seek to avoid unjust impacts on people, particularly those related to sensitive characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief.</p>

        <div class="content" id="safety">
          <p>We will continue to develop and apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of harm. We will design our AI systems to be appropriately cautious, and seek to develop them in accordance with best practices in AI safety research. In appropriate cases, we will test AI technologies in constrained environments and monitor their operation after deployment.</p>

          <p>We will design AI systems that provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal. Our AI technologies will be subject to appropriate human direction and control.</p>
